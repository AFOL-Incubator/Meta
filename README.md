This repository is a place to outline the basics of what AFOL Incubator is. It (and the rest of AFOL Incubator) are being allowed to sit fairly empty in public (think of it as a public alpha), because this should be a product of the community at every step of the way. You're encouraged to step in and help out with anything you see here. While this is set up to handle software, most of our resources will be human-readable and easily edited directly from the GitHub site.

In short, AFOL Incubator is a community and set of resources for creating AFOLs and growing the skills that expand the hobby. It is intended as a permanent set of guidelines to help people participate in (or even run) public displays of original LEGO creations.

## AFOL?
AFOL is a bit of a misnomer. We are using it (much as the LEGO company generally does) to describe people who build models to be displayed in public. The AFOL community is usually understood to mean people who are active in online LEGO fan communities, attend conventions, participate in LEGO shows, build original creations, and show off those original creations at those conventions and shows (we'll call those "display opportunities"). This sells short the many people who are very much fans of LEGO, but don't do those things. You can read a defense of them at https://ramblingbrick.com/2016/01/31/how-to-be-an-afol/ We don't mean to dismissive or disrespectful of those other perfectly valid ways to be a fan of LEGO, but this resource is not for people who don't build things for public display (unless those people want to get involved with display opportunities) and we'd rather focus on creating useful resources here than on finding clearer terminology.

Additionally, not everything on this site is age-specific. It is aimed at adults, but that generally boils down to "people who can buy their own LEGO, control their own schedule, and transport themselves (and their creations) to an event". If your age is below 18 or 21, be prepared to run into events that restrict your participation in some way. Inclusiveness is something many of us strive for, but it's rarely the top priority.

## Resources
We would like to develop the following resources as part of AFOL Incubator:
- A repository of resources on finding display opportunities
- A repository of resources on how to manage a display
- A repository of resources on how to run an event
- An online forum for passing certain opportunities on to other AFOLs
- A quick reference of collaborative building standards
- A quick reference of other online resources
and whatever else may be of use for expanding the AFOL hobby.
