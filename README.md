# Meta

This repository is a place to outline the basics of what AFOL Incubator is. It (and the rest of AFOL Incubator) are being allowed to sit fairly empty in public (think of it as a public alpha), because this should be a product of the community at every step of the way. You're encouraged to step in and help out with anything you see here. While this is set up to handle software, most of our resources will be human-readable and easily edited directly from the GitHub site.

In short, AFOL Incubator is a community and set of resources for creating AFOLs and growing the skills that expand the hobby. It is intended as a permanent set of guidelines to help people participate in (or even run) public displays of original LEGO creations.

## AFOL?
AFOL is a bit of a misnomer. We are using it (much as the LEGO company generally does) to describe people who build models to be displayed in public. The AFOL community is usually understood to mean people who are active in online LEGO fan communities, attend conventions, participate in LEGO shows, build original creations, and show off those original creations at those conventions and shows (we'll call those "display opportunities"). This sells short the many people who are very much fans of LEGO, but don't do those things. You can read a defense of them at https://ramblingbrick.com/2016/01/31/how-to-be-an-afol/ We don't mean to dismissive or disrespectful of those other perfectly valid ways to be a fan of LEGO, but this resource is not for people who don't build things for public display (unless those people want to get involved with display opportunities) and we'd rather focus on creating useful resources here than on finding clearer terminology.

Additionally, not everything on this site is age-specific. It is aimed at adults, but that generally boils down to "people who can buy their own LEGO, control their own schedule, and transport themselves (and their creations) to an event". If your age is below 18 or 21, be prepared to run into events that restrict your participation in some way. Inclusiveness is something many of us strive for, but it's rarely the top priority.

## Resources
We would like to develop the following resources as part of AFOL Incubator:
- [Meta](https://github.com/AFOL-Incubator/Meta) A repository of resources on AFOL Incubator itself
- [Events](https://github.com/AFOL-Incubator/Events) A repository of resources on finding display opportunities
- A repository of resources on how to manage a display
- A repository of resources on how to run an event
- An online forum for passing certain opportunities on to other AFOLs
- A quick reference of collaborative building standards
- [Curricula](https://github.com/AFOL-Incubator/Curricula) A repository of presentations and handouts that can be given at events
- A reference on relevant games and activities
- A quick reference of other online resources
and whatever else may be of use for expanding the AFOL hobby.

## Why GitHub?
GitHub's primarily a software site, but the key thing is that it enables global collaboration. Git is a widely-known source code control system that's been found to be capable of handling versions and changes for projects far beyond software - if you poke around on GitHub, you'll find hundreds of repositories that list resources, document other projects, or save personal settings. GitHub is a powerful social network based around Git. Editing text files like the ones that make up the bulk of AFOL Incubator can be done entirely on the website. This allows us to use a powerful software development tool without requiring anyone to learn the ins-and-outs of the tool - but those of us who know how to handle Git repositories from the command line can quickly clone entire projects and have a local backup.

## Why the MIT License?
It's very important that we keep these resources available. The MIT License makes it trivial for people to legally and frictionlessly do essentially anything they want with these resources. This isn't dependant on walled-garden tools (like the LEGO Ambassador Network), technologies that fade in popularity (like the newsgroups on USENET or LUGNET), or anything that the LEGO company might pull the plug on some day (like LEGOFan.org or your Rebrick data). If the people in charge of this get hit by a bus tomorrow, someone else can start it up again somewhere else. Between the legal protections offered by this license and how quickly these resources can be copied with a "git clone" command, things we work on here can reasonably be expected to be available for the foreseeable future.

Other licenses (such as Creative Commons licenses) were also evaluated for this project, but the MIT license seemed like the best fit for the variety of material we hope will be available here over the years.
